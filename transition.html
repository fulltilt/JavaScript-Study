-transition can take a number of values, but only two are required:
  1.The name of the property we wish to animate
  2.The duration of the animation    

-If you plan on animating multiple properties, you can pass it a comma-separated list:

CSS
.btn {
  transition: transform 250ms, opacity 400ms;
}
.btn:hover {
  transform: scale(1.2);
  opacity: 0;
}
-you can specify the timing function through transition-timing-function

.btn {
  transition: transform 250ms;
  transition-timing-function: linear;
}
Or, we can pass it directly to the transition shorthand property:

CSS
.btn {
  transition: transform 250ms linear;
}
-'ease' is the default timing function
-you can create your own timing fxn via the cubic-bezier(...) fxn

-'will-change' is a property that allows us to hint to the browser that we're going to animate the selected element, and that it should optimize for this case.
.btn {
  will-change: transform;
}

-you can inline the transition-delay attribute but it's recommended to do it separately else you have 2 time variables and it doesn't
specify which is which
