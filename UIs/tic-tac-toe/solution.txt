Rendering
To make the board responsive, CSS Grid was utilized in the code. CSS Grid is a powerful layout system that allows for the creation of two-dimensional grid layouts. Here's how CSS Grid was used to make the game board responsive:

Grid Container: The game board is wrapped in a <div> element with the class name board. This element serves as the grid container for the cells.
Grid Template Columns: To define the number and width of the columns in the grid, display: grid and grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr) was applied to the grid container. This rule sets the grid container to use the grid layout and specifies that it should have three columns with equal widths. The repeat(3, 1fr) syntax means to repeat the column size definition (1fr) three times.
Cell Sizing: Each cell within the grid is represented by a <button> element with the class name "cell". The following CSS rule defines the sizing and appearance of the cells:
The font-size property is set using the min() function. It ensures that the font size of the cells is responsive and adapts based on the available width of the viewport. The 48px value is the fallback size, and 10vw represents 10% of the viewport width.
The aspect-ratio property is set to 1 / 1, ensuring that each cell maintains a square shape regardless of its content.
Responsive Behavior: By using CSS Grid and defining the cell sizing based on the viewport width, the game board becomes responsive. As the viewport width decreases, the grid layout adapts, and the cells adjust their size accordingly. The min() function in the font-size property ensures that the font size does not become too large on smaller screens, providing a better user experience.
Overall, CSS Grid provides a flexible and responsive layout for the game board by defining the number of columns and adjusting the cell size based on the available space. This allows the game board to maintain its structure and usability across different screen sizes and devices.

State
There are two core pieces of state:

board - An array representing the state of the game board. It is initialized as an array of null values with a length of 9. Each element of the array corresponds to a cell on the game board and can have one of three values: 'X', 'O', or null, representing the marks made by players X, O, or an empty cell, respectively. The state is updated using the setBoard function.
xIsPlaying - A boolean value indicating whether it is currently player X's turn. It is initialized as true. The state is updated using the setIsXPlaying function.
determineWinner
The determineWinner function is responsible for determining if there is a winner in the Tic-Tac-Toe game based on the current state of the board by iterating through all possible winning combinations and checks if the cells in each combination have the same mark. It returns the winning mark if a winning line is found, or null if there is no winner yet.

The function takes a board parameter, which is an array representing the state of the game board. It iterates over the CELLS_IN_A_LINE array, which contains all the possible combinations of cell indices that form a winning line in the Tic-Tac-Toe game. Each combination consists of three indices representing the cells in a row, column, or diagonal. Since the board size is relatively small, it is possible to enumerate all the possible combinations. If the board size is larger then this approach won't scale well.

Inside the loop, the current combination of cell indices is destructured into three variables: x, y, and z. These variables represent the indices of the cells that need to be checked for equality.

The function then checks if the values in the board array at indices x, y, and z are not null (indicating that the cells are not empty) and are all equal to each other. If this condition is satisfied, it means that there is a winning line formed by the marks in the cells. If a winning line is found, the function returns the value of the mark (either 'X' or 'O') that is present in the winning line. This indicates which player has won the game.

If no winning line is found after checking all the combinations, the function returns null, indicating that there is no winner yet.

Test Cases
Initial Board State
Verify that the game board is displayed correctly with 9 empty cells.
Verify that the status message indicates it's player X's turn.
Marking Cells
Click on an empty cell.
Verify that the cell is marked with an "X" and the turn switches to player O.
Click on another empty cell.
Verify that the second cell is marked with an "O" and the turn switches back to player X.
Repeat this process for a few more cells to ensure the marks are placed correctly and the turn alternates between players.
Winning Conditions
Create a winning line for player X or player O by marking three cells in a row, column, or diagonal.
Verify that the status message displays the winning player's message correctly.
Verify that no further marks can be made after the game is won.
Click on the "Reset" button.
Verify that the board is cleared and the game restarts with player X's turn.
Draw Condition
Fill all the cells on the board without creating a winning line.
Verify that the status message displays a draw message correctly.
Verify that no further marks can be made after the draw.
Click on the "Reset" button.
Verify that the board is cleared, and the game restarts with player X's turn.
Accessibility
Use a screen reader to navigate and interact with the game.
Verify that the status message, cell markings, and buttons are announced correctly by the screen reader.
Verify that the game can be played and reset using only keyboard navigation.
Responsive Design
Test the game on different screen sizes, such as desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
Verify that the game board and cells adjust correctly to different screen sizes.
Ensure that the game remains playable and visually appealing on smaller screens.
Accessibility
The code includes some accessibility features to ensure a better user experience for people using assistive technologies:

The aria-label attribute is set on each cell button. It describes the action that will be performed when the cell is clicked, indicating which cell will be marked as 'X' or 'O'.
The aria-live attribute is set to "polite" on the <div> element containing the status message. It indicates that the content of the element may be updated dynamically and should be announced by screen readers.
The <span> element inside each cell button has the aria-hidden attribute set to true. This hides the cell mark (X or O) from screen readers, as the mark is already announced using the aria-label attribute on the button itself. This avoids redundant or confusing information for users of assistive technologies.
