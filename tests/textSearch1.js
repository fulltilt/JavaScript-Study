/*
In browsers, we are able to find specific words or phrases within a webpage by using Ctrl + F (Windows, Linux) or âŒ˜ + F (Mac) and entering the search term. Matches which appear will be highlighted in yellow.

Let's implement a simple version of a browser's in-webpage search with the difference being we're given a string (as opposed to HTML) and search matches appear bolded.

Given a content string and a query string, implement a function textSearch that finds all case-insensitive matches with the query string, wrapping the matches in <b>...</b> tags.

Examples
textSearch('The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog', 'fox');
// 'The Quick Brown <b>Fox</b> Jumps Over The Lazy Dog'
textSearch('The hardworking Dog overtakes the lazy dog', 'dog');
// 'The hardworking <b>Dog</b> overtakes the lazy <b>dog</b>'
A character will not match the same query more than once, with letters appearing earlier taking priority.

textSearch('aaa', 'aa');
// '<b>aa</b>a'
// This is because the second character cannot be used as a match again.
Consecutive matches should be combined into a single <b> tag.


textSearch('aaaa', 'aa');
// Correct: '<b>aaaa</b>'
// Wrong: '<b>aa</b><b>aa</b>'

This question evaluates one's ability to manipulate arrays and strings in JavaScript, which is certainly an essential skill for Front End development.

Clarification Questions
Your interviewer might not necessarily spell out all the requirements for you upfront. Ideally you start by thinking about all the possible situations and edge cases.

What if the query string is an empty string or the input string string is an empty string?
Return the string as-is.
Solution
One might think of leveraging regular expressions (regex), via RegExp. Regex is not easy to use here because we need to combine the tags for consecutive matches.

Let's try to think backwards from the desired output: we want to output a string with the substrings that exist in the query string wrapped in <b> tags. Therefore we need to know where exactly to insert the opening <b> tags and closing </b> tags. We can create a boolean array of same length as the string with every value defaulting to false. The value of boldChars[index] indicates whether the character at that index in the original string needs to be bold.

// #1: Basic case.
// string: "aaabcaa", query: 'abc'
// boldChars: [false, false, true, true, true, false, false]
// result: "aa<b>abc</b>aa"

// #2: Multiple matches case.
// string: "aaabcaabc", query: 'abc'
// boldChars: [false, false, true, true, true, false, true, true, true]
// result: "aa<b>abc</b>a<b>abc</b>"

// #2: Consecutive case.
// string: "aababcac", query: 'ab'
// boldChars: [false, true, true, true, true, false, false, false]
// result: "a<b>abab</b>cac"
The beginning of a span of consecutive chunks of true is where we insert the opening tag <b> and the end is where we add a closing </b>.

To identify which characters need to be bold, we do a naive substring match at each character in string for each query. Flipping the boolean value at each matching character's index to true. However, because of the "one character can only match the same query once" condition, we have to increment i to go past the current query when there's a match. Be careful of off-by-one errors here.

Because we separate out the function into two steps: (1) identification of bold characters, (2) rendering of the <b> tags, we will not run into the issue of combining the tags for consecutive matches.

/**
 * @param {string} string
 * @param {string} query
 * @return {string}

export default function textSearch(string, query) {
    if (string.trim() === '' || query.trim() === '') {
      return string;
    }
  
    const boldChars = Array.from({ length: string.length }, () => 0);
  
    for (let i = 0; i < string.length; ) {
      const substr = string.slice(i, i + query.length);
      if (substr.toLowerCase() === query.toLowerCase()) {
        boldChars.fill(1, i, i + query.length);
        // Start from next character if there's a match since one
        // character cannot match the same query more than once.
        i = i + query.length;
      } else {
        i++;
      }
    }
  
    let highlightedString = '';
    for (let i = 0; i < string.length; i++) {
      // When the current character should be bolded
      // and the previous character should not be bolded,
      // append an opening tag to the final string.
      const shouldAddOpeningTag = boldChars[i] === 1 && boldChars[i - 1] !== 1;
      // When the current character should be bolded
      // and the next character should not be bolded,
      // append a closing tag to the final string.
      const shouldAddClosingTag = boldChars[i] === 1 && boldChars[i + 1] !== 1;
      let char = string[i];
  
      if (shouldAddOpeningTag) {
        char = '<b>' + char;
      }
  
      if (shouldAddClosingTag) {
        char = char + '</b>';
      }
      highlightedString += char;
    }
  
    return highlightedString;
  }
  Edge Cases
  Empty string
  Empty query
  Notes
  We use Array.prototype.fill() to mutate the boolean array conveniently when we find a substring match. The method fill is one of the few methods that mutate arrays. As of writing, there are 9 methods in total that mutates arrays: pop, push, reverse, shift, sort, splice, unshift, copyWithin and fill. Check out Does it mutate where there is a nice list of mutating array methods with more details.
